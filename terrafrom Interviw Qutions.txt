12. *How do you perform a Terraform resource import?*
    - *Answer:* Use the terraform import command to bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management by mapping it to a Terraform resource.

13. **What is the purpose of terraform refresh?**
    - *Answer:* terraform refresh updates the state file with the latest information from the real infrastructure, synchronizing it with the actual state.

14. *How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?*
    - *Answer:* Terraform automatically manages dependencies by analyzing the resource graph and determining the correct order of operations.

15. **What is a data source in Terraform?**
    - *Answer:* Data sources allow Terraform to query and use information from external sources, such as querying existing resources or retrieving data from APIs.

16. **What is the difference between count and for_each in Terraform?**
    - *Answer:* count creates multiple instances of a resource based on an integer value, while for_each creates instances based on a map or set of strings, providing more flexibility in resource creation.

17. **What is a lifecycle block in Terraform?**
    - *Answer:* The lifecycle block is used to manage the lifecycle of resources, including options like create_before_destroy and prevent_destroy.

18. *How do you handle resource dependencies in Terraform modules?*
    - *Answer:* Resource dependencies can be managed using depends_on to explicitly specify dependencies between resources or modules.

19. **What is terraform taint?**
    - *Answer:* terraform taint marks a resource for recreation during the next terraform apply, which can be useful if a resource is in a degraded state.

20. *How can you optimize Terraform performance?*
    - *Answer:* Performance can be optimized by reducing the number of resources, using count and for_each efficiently, and managing state files properly.

### *Advanced Concepts*

21. *Explain how Terraform handles resource changes.*
    - *Answer:* Terraform determines the changes needed by comparing the current state to the desired state and then applies the necessary modifications. This includes creating, updating, or deleting resources as required.

22. **What are terraform workspace and how are they used?**
    - *Answer:* Workspaces are used to manage multiple states within a single Terraform configuration, allowing different environments or variations of infrastructure.

23. *How do you perform rolling updates with Terraform?*
    - *Answer:* Rolling updates can be managed by configuring lifecycle blocks or using third-party tools like Terraform’s count parameter in combination with modules.

24. **What are Terraform variables and how are they used?**
    - *Answer:* Variables allow users to pass dynamic values into Terraform configurations, making configurations more flexible and reusable.

25. *How do you use Terraform with CI/CD pipelines?*
    - *Answer:* Terraform can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines by automating commands such as terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply within pipeline scripts.

26. **What is terraform validate and why is it important?**
    - *Answer:* terraform validate checks the syntax and validity of configuration files to ensure they are correct before running terraform plan or apply.

27. **How do you use terraform graph?**
    - *Answer:* terraform graph generates a visual representation of the dependency graph of resources, which helps in understanding the relationships between resources.

28. **Explain how terraform provisioners work.**
    - *Answer:* Provisioners are used to execute scripts or commands on resources after they have been created, such as installing software or configuring applications.

29. *How do you handle Terraform state locking?*
    - *Answer:* State locking prevents concurrent operations from corrupting the state file. This is typically managed through remote state storage solutions like AWS S3 with DynamoDB for locking.
