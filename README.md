## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- An account with the cloud provider you intend to use (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Required permissions to create resources in the cloud provider.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generic-terraform-code.git
   cd generic-terraform-code
   ```

2. **Configure your provider:**

   Update the provider configuration in the `main.tf` file with your credentials and desired settings.

3. **Initialize Terraform:**

   Run the following command to initialize the working directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Plan the deployment:**

   Review the resources that will be created by running:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration:**

   To create the resources, run:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Destroy the resources:**

   When you are done and want to clean up, run:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Usage

This Terraform code can be customized for your specific needs. Modify the variables in `variables.tf` and the resource configurations in `main.tf` to suit your infrastructure requirements.

## Variables

The following variables are available for customization:

| Variable Name | Description                     | Default Value |
|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| `example_var` | Example variable description     | `default`     |
| `region`      | Cloud provider region            | `us-east-1`   |

## Outputs

The following outputs are available after deployment:

| Output Name     | Description                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `example_output` | Example output description     |
